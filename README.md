# LDMX8GeVScripts
LDMX Background Rejection Analysis at 8 GeV.

Maintained by Erik Wallin. 

## Eval
Evaluate the BDT score of ldmx-sw 1.7.0, v9-geometry data, vetoing only on ECal features. Note that you will have to provide your paths to the ldmx-sw shared libraries and header files. 

## TODO
Add scripts to check for duplicate events.

Add pre-processing macros to create ROOT-files for BDT training.
